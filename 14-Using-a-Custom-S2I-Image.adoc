Using Custom S2I Image to deploy a SpringBoot Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will deploy a SpringBoot application using a custom
source to image builder image. You will learn how to use an s2i image that
is not on openshift to build your application.

*Step 1:* Using the knowledge you gained from the earlier labs, check if you are in
the project with name `hco-UserName`. *Remember* to substitute the
`UserName` with your userid.

Than clean up our project with the 'oc delete' command.

* Note:* We are using an S2I builder image from Red Hat registry directly. In the next lab we will learn more about images and imagestreams.

*Step 2:* Create a new application using SpringBoot S2I Builder image.
Here we will deploy sample code from a git repository
https://github.com/hcs-company/spring-sample-app. Please take time
to understand the code; it is pretty simple.

....
$ oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift~https://github.com/hcs-company/spring-sample-app --name=bootapp


--> Found Docker image b4b953c (3 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift"

    Java Applications
    -----------------
    Platform for building and running plain Java applications (fat-jar and flat classpath)

    Tags: builder, java

    * An image stream tag will be created as "openjdk18-openshift:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/hcs-company/spring-sample-app will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "bootapp:latest"
      * Every time "openjdk18-openshift:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "bootapp"
    * Ports 8080/tcp, 8443/tcp, 8778/tcp will be load balanced by service "bootapp"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "bootapp"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "openjdk18-openshift" created
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "bootapp" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "bootapp" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "bootapp" created
    service "bootapp" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/bootapp' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/bootapp'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

Expose Service to create a route

....
$ oc expose service bootapp

route.route.openshift.io/bootapp exposed
....

Check the route

....
$ oc get route

NAME      HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
bootapp   bootapp-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl             bootapp    8080-tcp                 None
....

Wait for your application to be built and deployed. Using the knowlege
you gained from the previous labs, check your build logs by running
`oc logs -f <build pod name>`

*Step 4*

Test your application by using the hostname assigned in the route.

Congratulations!! You are now running a SpringBoot application on
OpenShift.
