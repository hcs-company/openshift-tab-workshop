Using Persistent Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how you can request storage
from OpenShift and have it attach to your application.

Containers, by design, are ephemeral. In short, if you want your application
to store persistent data; you will need to attach to a backend storage system.

In this Lab, we will be:

* Deploying an application that takes uploads
* Upload a File, and delete the pod
* Attach persistant storage
* Upload a File, and delete the pod

*NOTE:* Storage provisioning must be setup by the Operations Team before proceeding.


*Step 1: Deploy Application*

First we deploy the application

....
$ oc new-app php~https://github.com/hcs-company/openshift-php-upload-demo
....
Once the application is deployed expose the route

....
$ oc get svc
NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
oopenshift-php-upload-demo  ClusterIP   172.30.104.218   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   36s

$ oc expose svc openshift-php-upload-demo

route.route.openshift.io/openshift-php-upload-demo exposed
....

Visit your application; it should look like this

*Step 2: Test with ephemeral storage*

Pick a file to upload and upload it to the app. Once uploaded you can view
a list of file when you click `List Uploaded Files`. It should look something
like this

image::list-uploaded-files.png[image]

You can see where the uploaded files are if you use `oc rsh`. They are uploaded
under `/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`

....
$ oc get pods

NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-bxlxp   1/1       Running     0          2m

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-bxlxp
sh-4.2$ ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
hcs_company_logo.png
sh-4.2$ exit
....

Delete this pod.

....
$ oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-1-bxlxp
pod "openshift-php-upload-demo-1-bxlxp" deleted
....

Now login to your new pod that got spun up. Your data is gone!
....
$ oc get pods

NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          6m
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-vkwmx   1/1       Running     0          1m

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-vkwmx
sh-4.2$  ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
sh-4.2$ exit
....

*Step 3: Requesting Storage*

In OpenShift, Storage is abstracted out to where one simply "requests" storage
and it's up to the backend adminsitrator to provide the solution

On the webconsole on the left side navigation click on "Storage". It will bing
you to the storage overview page.

On the right hand side; click the "Create Storage" button. This will take you
to the "Create Storage" page.

image::create-storage.png[image]

Here you need to enter the following

----
* Storage Class: cinder
* Name: myclaim
* Access Mode: Shared Access (RWO)
* Size: 1 GiB
----

The `Storage Class` will be given to you by your instructor. The `Name` must be
unique to the project namespace. The `Access Mode` means "how many apps can access
this storage". For block storage (cinder) you'd choose `Singe User (RWO)`. The `Size`
is set to `1 GB` just for testing.

Once you click on "Create" it'll go from a `Pending` stage to `Bound`. You can see
this on the command-line as well by checking your `pvc` (Which stands for Persistant
Volume Claim)

....
$ oc get pvc

NAME      STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
myclaim   Bound     pvc-8926de8a-7305-11e9-a85d-fa163e51c3a4   1Gi        RWO            cinder         1h
....

Get yourself familair with the configuration

....
$ oc get pvc myclaim -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  annotations:
    pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed: "yes"
    pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: "yes"
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: cinder
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/cinder
  creationTimestamp: 2019-05-10T09:25:22Z
  name: myclaim
  namespace: hco-mkerker
  resourceVersion: "20228429"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/hco-mkerker/persistentvolumeclaims/myclaim
  uid: 8926de8a-7305-11e9-a85d-fa163e51c3a4
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  volumeName: pvc-8926de8a-7305-11e9-a85d-fa163e51c3a4
status:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  phase: Bound
....

We will now bind this storage to the application's path of where it is
storing the files. This is under `/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`. You need
to add the volume to the `deploymentConfig` of `openshift-php-upload-demo`.

....
$ oc set volume dc/openshift-php-upload-demo  --add -t pvc --claim-name=myclaim --mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded
info: Generated volume name: volume-ghvz5
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/openshift-php-upload-demo volume updated
....

*Step 3: Testing Configuration*

This will trigger a new deployment. Login to your pod to see the mount.

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg   1/1       Running     0          1m

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg
sh-4.2$ df -h /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
Filesystem                                        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
172.16.1.11:vol_464dc941ae641d2693b1382cc221a0b5 1016M   33M  983M   4% /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
....

Upload a file like before. Once uploaded; delete the pod

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg   1/1       Running     0          2m

$ oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg
pod "openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg" deleted
....
Log into the newly spunup pod and verify that your file is still there!

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-4brh0   1/1       Running     0          58s

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-8-4brh0
sh-4.2$ ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
