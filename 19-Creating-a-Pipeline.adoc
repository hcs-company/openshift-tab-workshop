Creating a CI/CD Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.

In modern software projects many teams utilize the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). By setting up a tool chain that continuously builds, tests, and stages software releases, a team can ensure that their product can be reliably released at any time. OpenShift can be an enabler in the creation and management of this tool chain.
In this lab we walk through creating a simple example of a CI/CD [pipeline][1] utlizing Jenkins, all running on top of OpenShift! The Jenkins job will trigger OpenShift to build and deploy a test version of the application, validate that the deployment works, and then tag the test version into production.

*Step 1: Instantiate a Jenkins server in your project*

CAUTION: Be sure you use version 3.9 of the OpenShift-CLI; by using command `oc version`.

     Jenkins service, without persistent storage.

     WARNING: Any data stored will be lost upon pod destruction. Only use this template for testing.

     A Jenkins service has been created in your project.  Log into Jenkins with your OpenShift account.  The tutorial at https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md contains more information about using this template.

    Use 'oc start-build frontend' to start a build.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

*Step 3: Confirm you can access Jenkins*

....
$ oc get route

NAME       HOST/PORT                                          PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION     WILDCARD
frontend   frontend-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl             frontend   <all>     edge            None
jenkins    jenkins-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl              jenkins    <all>     edge/Redirect   None
....

Use Jenkins HOST/PORT to access through web browser

image::ocp-lab-cicd-jenkins-overview.png[image]

Select "Login with OpenShift" from Jenkins login page

image::ocp-lab-cicd-jenkins-login-1.png[image]

The OpenShift login page is displayed in a new browser tab.

Login with your OpenShift user name and password

Once logged in, click the [Allow selected permissions] button and you should see the Jenkins dashboard.

*Step 4: Create a Jenkins pipeline using OpenShift*

We will be creating the following very simple (4) stage Jenkins pipeline.

1. Build the application from source.
2. Deploy the test version of the application.
3. Submit for approval, then tag the image for production, otherwise abort.
4. Scale the application.

The first step is to create a build configuration that is based on a Jenkins pipeline strategy. The pipeline is written
in the GROOVY language using a Jenkins file format.

Copy and paste the following into bash.

....
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcs-company/openshift-tab-workshop/master/jenkinks/pipeline.yaml

buildconfig "pipeline" created
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/pipeline created
....

Use the following OpenShift build configuration to create the pipeline.



*Step 5: Start the pipeline*
Using the OpenShift Web Console, choose *Builds* -> *Pipelines*

image::ocp-lab-cicd-start-pipeline.png[image]

When the pipeline starts, OpenShift uploads the pipeline to the Jenkins server for execution. As it runs, the various stages trigger OpenShift to build and deploy the frontend microservice. After a Jenkins user approves the frontend deployment, Jenkins triggers OpenShift to tag the image stream with the ":prod" tag then scales the frontend-prod deployment for (2) replicas.

The Jenkins dashboard should indicate that a new build is executing.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-jenkins-build-exec-status.png[image]

Back in the OpenShift Web Console, watch the pipeline execute. Once the "deployFrontEnd" stage completes, you should be able to visit the route for the frontend service in a web browser.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-pipeline-input.png[image]

Click on "Input Required" and you should get redirected to the Jenkins Web Console to
approve the promotion to production.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-jenkins-promote.png[image]

Now return to the OpenShift Web Console and watch the pipeline finish.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-pipeline-stages.png[image]

Confirm the *frontend-prod* has deployed 2 pods.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-create-route.png[image]

Now *create a secure route* with TLS edge termination the *frontend-prod* service so the application can be visited.

image::ocp-lab-cicd-route-tls.png[image]

*Step 6: Confirm both the test and production services are available*

Browse to both services


Use the `oc get routes` command to get the HOST/PORT (URLs) needed to access the frontend and frontend-prod services. Your HOST/PORT values will differ
from the example below.

....
$ oc get routes

NAME            HOST/PORT                            PATH      SERVICES        PORT      TERMINATION     WILDCARD
frontend        frontend-cicd-XX.apps.eadgbe.net                  frontend        <all>     edge            None
frontend-prod   frontend-prod-cicd-XX.apps.eadgbe.net             frontend-prod   web       edge            None
....

Use a web browser to visit the HOST/PORT (URLs) for the frontend and frontend-prod services. Don't forget the ```https://``` prefix.



Select services' links from Overview page.

*Step 7: Edit the pipeline*

Now make a change to the pipeline. For example, in the *scaleUp* stage, change the number
of replicas to 3.

Technically speaking, a rebuild from source is not needed to scale up a deployment. We use
this simple example to illustrate how a pipeline may be edited within OpenShift.


If you are comfortable using the **vi** editor:

....
$ oc edit bc/pipeline
....


image::ocp-lab-cicd-pipeline-edit.png[image]



Save your changes and run the pipeline again to confirm the *frontend-prod* deployment has
deployed 3 pods.

Summary
~~~~~~~

In this lab you have very quickly and easily constructed a basic Build/Test/Deploy pipeline. Although our example was very basic it introduces you to a powerful DevOps feature of OpenShift through the leveraging of Jenkins. This can be extended to support complex real-world continuous delivery requirements. Read more about the use of Jenkins on OpenShift [here][3] and more about Jenkins [here][4].
