Create an App from a Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image.

*Step 1: Login with CLI to OpenShift*

*Note:* Please replace *UserName* and *Password* with the username/password assigned to you in
the commands below.

....
$ oc oc login https://playground.hotcontainers.nl:8443 -u UserName -p Password
....

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly
created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run
the following command:

....
$ oc get projects

NAME          DISPLAY NAME          STATUS
hco-UserName  Project for UserName  Active
....
You see that our project is started with hco following with your UserName.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following
command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

....
$ oc status

In project Project for UserName (hco-UserName) on server https://playground.hotcontainers.nl:8443

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
....

*Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image*

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an
existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on
dockerhub that just says 'Welcome to OpenShift V3. Let us just use
that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the
`oc new-app` command as shown below:

....
$ oc new-app quay.io/hcs_company/welcome-php --name=welcome

--> Found Docker image bf9879e (2 years old) from quay.io for "quay.io/hcs_company/welcome-php"

    chx/welcome-php-1:b68a2d86
    --------------------------
    Platform for building and running PHP 5.6 applications

    Tags: builder, php, php56, rh-php56

    * An image stream tag will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "welcome"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "welcome"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "welcome"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "welcome" created
    service "welcome" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/welcome'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in
a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer
pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
....

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the
other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer
pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to
`Running` status.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-dkyyq   1/1       Running   0          56s
....

*Step 3: Add a Route for your application*

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the
following command to view the list of services in the project (you
can also use `oc get svc` shorthand).

....
$ oc get services

NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   ClusterIP   172.30.117.43   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
....

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot
access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose`
command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you
can access it from the browser.

*Note*: In this example, I am using a domain name of
`apps.workshop.osecloud.com`. *Ask the instructor for the domain name suffix* for
your setup an change it.

....
$ oc expose service welcome --name=welcome

route.route.openshift.io/welcome exposed
....

*Step 4: Try your application*

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking
for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

....
$ oc get routes

NAME      HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
welcome   welcome-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl            welcome    8080-tcp                 None

$ curl -Is <route>
....

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker
image on OpenShift.

*Step 4: Clean up*

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were
created in your project.

....
$ oc get all

NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/welcome-1-pnpt5   1/1       Running   0          9m

NAME                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicationcontroller/welcome-1   1         1         1         9m

NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/welcome   ClusterIP   172.30.117.43   <none>        8080/TCP   9m

NAME                                         REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/welcome   1          1         1         config,image(welcome:latest)

NAME                                     DOCKER REPO                                            TAGS      UPDATED
imagestream.image.openshift.io/welcome   docker-registry.default.svc:5000/hco-UserName/welcome   latest    9 minutes ago

NAME                               HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
route.route.openshift.io/welcome   welcome-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl             welcome    8080-tcp                 None
....

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

....
$ oc delete all --all

pod "welcome-1-pnpt5" deleted
replicationcontroller "welcome-1" deleted
service "welcome" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
....

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application,
the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more
fun stuff!
