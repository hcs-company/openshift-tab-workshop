Changing code on the fly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will learn how to make changes to the code on the local
machine and immediately sync it with the code running in a pod.

*Note:* This model of programming is useful for interpreted languages.

*Prerequisite:* This lab assumes that you have git CLI installed on your laptop.

*Step 1: Clone the git repository locally* Clone the following git
repository to your workstation.
https://github.com/hcs-company/nodejs-hello using the command

....
$ git clone https://github.com/hcs-company/nodejs-hello
....

This is a very simple nodejs application. Feel free to understand the
code.

*Step 2: Create the application*

Change to the `nodejs-hello` folder.

....
$ cd nodejs-hello
....

Now let us create an application using this code.

....
$ oc new-app . --image-stream=nodejs:4

--> Found image a8fd5c5 (11 months old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "4" for "nodejs:4"

    Node.js 4
    ---------
    Node.js 4 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Node.js 4 applications and frameworks. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs4

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/hcs-company/nodejs-hello#master will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "nodejs-hello:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "nodejs-hello"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "nodejs-hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "nodejs-hello"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "nodejs-hello" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "nodejs-hello" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "nodejs-hello" created
    service "nodejs-hello" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/nodejs-hello' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/nodejs-hello'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

Create a route

....
$ oc expose service nodejs-hello
route "nodejs-hello" exposed
....

Wait for the build to complete and test the application

....
$ oc get route

NAME         HOST/PORT                                              PATH      SERVICES       PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nodejs-hello nodejs-hello-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl             nodejs-hello   8080-tcp                 None
....

....
$ $ curl nodejs-hello-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl
Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
....

*Step 3: Make code changes and sync with rsync*

Let us now make a small change to the application on your workstation.

Edit `server.js` file using your favorite text editor (I use vi). The
code snippet below displays the welcome message

....
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
....

Let us make a small change to insert a `\n` character after the welcome
message so that the hostname is displayed on a different line. The
edited code should look like this.

....
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to OpenShift!! \n My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
....

Run `oc get pods` to get your application pod name as shown below:

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-hello-1-8qigc   1/1       Running     0          8m
nodejs-hello-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          9m
....

Use `oc rsync` to sync the code from the local workstation to the pod as
shown below

....
$ oc rsync . nodejs-hello-1-8qigc:/opt/app-root/src --no-perms=true --exclude=.git

building file list ... done
package.json
server.js

sent 596 bytes  received 76 bytes  1344.00 bytes/sec
total size is 807  speedup is 1.20
....

The command above will copy the code from the local machine to the pod.
Note that +
* `/opt/app-root/src` is the default home location on the pod +
* `--exclude=.git` will omit the hidden git folder

Now test the application again. This time it should show the output in
two lines as below:

....
$ curl nodejs-hello-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl
Welcome to OpenShift!!
My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
....

Note that pod did not restart, we did not have to check into git repo
and rebuild the image. The changes moved from your workstation directly
to the pod.

Developers can use this mechanism to quickly test the changes on the
fly. When ready they can commit the changes to the source control
repository.

You can repeat a few more changes and enjoy the rsync!!!
