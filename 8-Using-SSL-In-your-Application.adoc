Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: View the routing config*

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route`
command

....
$ oc get route/ks -o yaml

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: Route for application's http service.
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-05-09T12:09:48Z
  labels:
    application: ks
    template: eap64-basic-s2i
    xpaas: 1.4.14
  name: ks
  namespace: hco-mkerker
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    kind: TemplateInstance
    name: b88a6cc8-83bb-4dbb-8bc3-aae1ec606ef3
    uid: 576fcaaf-7253-11e9-a85d-fa163e51c3a4
  resourceVersion: "19988011"
  selfLink: /apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/hco-mkerker/routes/ks
  uid: 5780846b-7253-11e9-a610-fa163e484090
spec:
  host: ks-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-05-09T12:09:48Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: ks-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is
running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports `80` and
`443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod
is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in
order to get the `443` mapping to work.

*Step 2: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

....
$ oc edit route/ks
....

You are going to add 
```
tls: 
  termination: edge
```
right below the `host:` *spec:* section. It should look something like this.

....
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: Route for application's http service.
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2019-05-09T12:09:48Z
  labels:
    application: ks
    template: eap64-basic-s2i
    xpaas: 1.4.14

  namespace: hco-mkerker
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    kind: TemplateInstance

    uid: 576fcaaf-7253-11e9-a85d-fa163e51c3a4
  resourceVersion: "19988011"
  selfLink: /apis/route.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/hco-mkerker/routes/ks
  uid: 5780846b-7253-11e9-a610-fa163e484090
spec:
  host: ks-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ks
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-05-09T12:09:48Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: ks-hco-mkerker.playground.hotcontainers.nl
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

*Step 3: Verify*

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://ks-hco-UserName.playground.hotcontainers.nl` URI.

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
from your application
